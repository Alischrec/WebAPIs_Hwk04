## About the Project:
<!-- The focus of this project was to utilize the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) as a base to create a functional, deployed application. The project was to create a working portfolio using Bootstap's grid system while incorporating personal information and images for viewing pleasure.
